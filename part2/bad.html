    <h2 id= habout>Who Ana Is</h2>
    <p id="pabout">
       Ana Gabriela Marcu is a 22 year old student at the University of Alberta, as a Bchelors of Science undergraduate. She is currently completing a double major program in Computing Science and Biological Sciences. This program has allowed her to study principles of computation and programming, as well as some fascinating molecular and cellular biology.

<div class="info" id="history">
    <h2 id="hhistory">What Ana Has Done</h2>
    <p id="phistory">
         I would like to describe some of the major projects Ana took part in. In the summer of 2013 she had the privilege of working with a software development team at Levven Electronics in database design for an internal sales system. She was also able to contribute to the data based web application. In the fall term of 2013, Ana was involved with a team of students to build an Android application for peersonal story telling. During the fall term, they worked with a client to build an interactive phonegap based Android/iOS/web app designed to help children eat healthy and exercise. In the summer of 2014, Ana geered more towards deepening her knowledge in biotechnology, with Dr. Bressler at the U of A, as she worked with his laboratory team on developing methods to deal with industrial waste food products, focusing on efficient ethanol fermentations.

<div class="info" id="future">
    <h2 id="hfuture">What Ana Would Like to Do</h2>
    <p id="pfuture">
    Ana would love to continue applying computing science in her future carrer, in different prospective areas such as database design, mobile applications or web design. She am open to deepening her knowledge and skills in these areas, as well as potentially learn new things. Ideally, Ana would also be able to apply what she has learned as a biology student in her future job, especially as bioinformatics and computational biology are ever increasing fields. Ana looks forward to discussing possible opportunities, either in IT or bioinformatics fields.
